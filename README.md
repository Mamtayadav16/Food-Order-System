# Food-Order-System
I have created two text files, one stores the item name, id, and price, and the other text file contains the coupon name, id, and discount. An object of each item is created using the Product class and stored in ArrayList. An object of each coupon is created using the Coupon class and stored in another ArrayList. 
Items will get displayed to users and they have to enter their id and quantity, bill will get generated and a suitable coupon based on the amount will get displayed. 
The user has to enter the coupon code and the bill with the discount will get displayed.
